# Overlay Takeouts

## Abstract
- most known takeouts base on a simple cascade with right handed single passes
- we propose a way to base takeouts on a wide range of siteswaps

## Introduction
- _prolonged version of abstract_
- _give references to explain the historic background_
- _tell how we differ from and continue that history_
- _one sentence solution introduction_

## Motivating Example
- _start with a boring standard take out pattern (round-about) pointing out the missing ways to get to something more interesting_
- _motivating example: delightfull_
- _explain trick, show what's opening up here_
- _take material from here:_ https://github.com/prechac/prechacthis/blob/a5bfcf09f936b70f18f1a9309e8a2ed3765d73da/2016-11-overlay-takeouts.md#generating-overlay-takeouts-1


## The General Principle
- _summarize the idea based on the example_
- _(1) take/create a prechac pattern, that has one self > 1+period/2_
- _(2) create solo siteswap of the same period containing that self -> but transform the self into a pass_
- _(3) juggle both at once_
- _(4) add some walking sequence to it_

## Fully fledged example Mission Impossible
- _What where we aiming for?/Requirements:_ 
    - _not too demanding for participants (throws, catches, number of clubs, "familiar" elements)_
    - _left right handed, i.e. odd period_
    - _possibility to correct a wrong handed 1.5p, e.g. club does 1 1.5p_
- _First approach: 1 2 3 4 2.5p and 0 1 2 1.5p overlayed to: 1 2 3 1.5p 2.5p_
- _take material from here:_ https://github.com/prechac/prechacthis/blob/a5bfcf09f936b70f18f1a9309e8a2ed3765d73da/2016-11-overlay-takeouts.md#going-forward---period-5

## Observations, Discussion
- _Point out that it is, at first, surprisingly hard to juggle the overlay, even though on masters both partial patterns_
- _Once you by pass the your thinking machinery, its actually not that hard, you become part of a clock work, which is what the whole takeout business is about_
- _Two step approach: (1) creating overlay prechacs, (2) dealing with runaround pecularities_

## Future Work
- _Describe the run around part of Mission Impossible in more detail (transition, starts, permutations)_
- _let's see how many interesting patterns can be generated that way_
- _See how Aidan's and Ed's notation can help to find a theory for the runaround part_
